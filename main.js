Described to be "mostly in charge" of the Fairy Council in the absence of the Fairy Godmother, Emerelda is gracious yet authoritative, and Alex's and Conner's first impression of her was a person "they would definitely want in their corner during an altercation". She was also capable of keeping a calm and imposing demeanor even in the face of what others would interpret as impertinence, and could even bring herself to listen to those who openly disagreed with the Fairy Council and, if necessary, even agree with those opinions if they were truly valid.");

Xanthous remains timid and ashamed of himself until Mother Goose helps him realize he should not feel shame for who he is.When Xanthous is in the twins' home watching over them, he is described as very strict, but fair. He isn't very impressed with the Otherworld's inventions (such as television), but this may be because he keeps switching on the fire alarm with his flames. When he presents Alex' case at the Inauguration Ball in A Grimm Warning, he is said to enjoy the attention of the crowd very much");
